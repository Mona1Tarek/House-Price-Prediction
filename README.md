# House Price Prediction - A simple linear regression project

## Project Description

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and other relevant factors. Accurate house price predictions are essential for real estate professionals, investors, and buyers to make informed decisions. The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can estimate house prices with a high degree of accuracy using historical data.

The project is divided into the following key components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the raw dataset for analysis. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or scaling numerical features. Proper data preprocessing ensures that the model can effectively learn patterns in the data.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from the existing data to improve model performance. This includes adding derived metrics, such as price per square foot, and incorporating neighborhood-level information to enhance the predictive power of the model.

3. **Model Development and Training**: Building and training regression models using popular machine learning frameworks like Scikit-learn, XGBoost, or TensorFlow. Various models, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, will be trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing approach.
